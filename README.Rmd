Here you can find the learning materials for the workshop **Learn Bayesian Analysis for the Speech Sciences** ([learnB4SS](https://learnb4ss.github.io)), in the form of an R package.

## Let's get started!

### Prerequisites

The first step is to install brms and its dependencies.
If you haven't yet done so, check out the installation instructions [here](https://learnb4ss.github.io/learnB4SS/articles/install-brms.html).

### Download the Starter Kit

To save you some hassle, we created a Starter Kit, which you can download from here: [Go to download page](https://github.com/learnB4SS/learnB4SS-kit).

The download page also contains instructions to get you set up.

*Alternative*. If you prefer not to use the Starter Kit, then you can just follow the [installation instructions for the learnB4SS package](https://learnb4ss.github.io/learnB4SS/articles/install-learnb4ss.html).
Note that the package and materials are best used from RStudio.
